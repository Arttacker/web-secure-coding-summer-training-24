Welcome to the official repository for the **Web Secure Coding** summer training organized by **Cyberus**. This repository contains all the code demos, resources, and examples used throughout the training sessions.

## ðŸ“š Training Overview

The Web Secure Coding training is designed for beginner students interested in learning about web application security. Over the course of the training, we cover essential topics such as:

- Introduction to Web and Web Applications
- Understanding HTTP and its Role in Web Security
- Basics of Databases and SQL
- Secure Coding Practices using Flask
- Identifying and Mitigating Common Web Vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF)

Each session includes a hands-on demo that allows students to experiment with both vulnerable and secure code, providing a practical understanding of the concepts discussed.

Each session is uploaded on a separate branch.
